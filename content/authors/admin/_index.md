I'm currently a postdoctoral research fellow in the Department of Philosophy at Ben-Gurion University, Israel. My area of specialty is Kant and modern philosophy, though I have further interests and teaching experience in ethics, political philosophy, metaphysics, philosophy of religion, and aesthetics. I earned a Ph.D. in Philosophy from Indiana University, with a minor in Germanic Studies, in September 2017. I wrote my dissertation entitled “Kant’s Theoretical Conception of God” under the direction of Allen Wood. After that I was a postdoc at Bar-Ilan University, affiliated with Ohad Nachtomy’s project on the life sciences in early modern philosophy.
