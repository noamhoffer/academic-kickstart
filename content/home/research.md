{{%expand "Abstract" %}}
In the pre-Critical period, Kant endorsed a theoretical a priori argument for the existence of God, usually called the possibility proof. Several commentators have noted that Kant’s account of the Transcendental Ideal in the Critique of Pure Reason involves an implicit criticism of this proof, although the nature of this criticism is still under dispute. The interpretation of Kant’s implicit criticism can address two issues: the first is the error in the proof itself, and the second is the motivating reason for committing the error. In this paper, I offer a new way to connect these two questions. In contrast with other accounts that locate the motivation for the error in a dialectical illusion stemming from reason’s interest in an unconditioned causal ground of all contingent existence, I argue that the motivation lies in another kind of unconditioned ground, an interest in collective unity. Unlike the conception of an unconditioned ground of existence, the notion of collective unity directly explains the problematic ontological assumption of the possibility proof, the existence of intelligible objects as the ground of possibility. I argue, that such platonic entities are assumed because they are amenable to the kind of unity prescribed by reason. But since the interest in collective unity has a legitimate regulative use when applied to the systematic unity of nature, the conception of God entailed by the possibility proof is retained as a regulative idea of reason.

{{%expand "Abstract" %}}
In the “Appendix to the Transcendental Dialectic” of the Critique of Pure 
Reason, Kant contends that the idea of God has a positive regulative role in the 
systematization of empirical knowledge. But why is this regulative role assigned to 
this specific idea? Kant’s account is rather opaque, and this question has also not 
received much attention in the literature. In this article, I argue that an adequate 
understanding of the regulative role of the idea of God depends on the specific 
metaphysical content Kant attributes to it in the Critique and other writings. I 
show that neither a heuristic principle of conceptual systematicity, nor conceiving 
God as a hypothesis of an intelligent designer, can satisfy the demands of reason 
to make the unity and necessity of the laws of nature intelligible. Regarding the 
positive account about the metaphysical content of the idea of God, I support 
my argument by referring to Kant’s pre-critical discussion of the usefulness of the 
conception of God for the project of science, and by expounding Kant’s critical 
account of the necessity of the laws of nature. Thus, my account sheds light on the 
continuity of Kant’s conception of God and his appropriation of his own rationalistic metaphysics.

(https://www.academia.edu/14545047/The_Relation_between_God_and_the_World_in_the_Pre-Critical_Kant_was_Kant_a_Spinozist)
{{%expand "Abstract" %}}
Andrew Chignell and Omri Boehm have recently argued that Kant’s
pre-Critical proof for the existence of God entails a Spinozistic conception
of God and hence substance monism. The basis for this reading is the
assumption common in the literature that God grounds possibilities by
exemplifying them. In this article I take issue with this assumption
and argue for an alternative Leibnizian reading, according to which
possibilities are grounded in essences united in God’s mind (later also
described as Platonic ideas intuited by God). I show that this view about
the distinction between God’s cognition of essences as the ground of
possibility and the actual world is not only explicitly stated by Kant, but is
also consistent with his metaphysical picture of teleology in nature and
causality during the pre-Critical period. Finally, I suggest that the
distinction between the conceptual order of essences embodied in the idea
of God and the order of the objects of experience plays a role in the
transition into the Critical system, where it is transformed into the
distinction between the intelligible and the sensible worlds.

- “Kant’s Teleology as the ‘True Apology’ to Leibniz’s Pre-Established Harmony” (under review)
{{%expand "Abstract" %}}
Should we take seriously Kant’s claim that his critical philosophy is the ‘true apology for Leibniz’? By exploring Kant’s attitude towards Leibniz’s doctrine of pre-established harmony, I argue that we should take it seriously because it sheds light on the development of Kant’s view about the role of teleology in science in general and in the life sciences in particular. I first present the general framework through which Kant appropriates Leibnizian doctrines as regulative ideals.  I then address Kant’s pre-critical engagement with pre-established harmony. While he rejected it as an account of causal relations between substances, he made extensive references to harmony between laws of nature. I argue that the critical development of this type of harmony allows Kant to appreciate one of Leibniz’s motivations in arguing for pre-established harmony, the compatibility of mechanistic and teleological causal laws. Finally, I show how this affinity becomes explicit in the Critique of the Power of Judgment in Kant’s novel position on the legitimacy of teleological explanations of organisms. I demonstrate this by pointing to Kant’s complex attitude towards 18th century theories of epigenesis.

## Dissertation 
Title: Kant's Theoretical Conception of God
{{%expand "Abstract" %}}
​My dissertation argues for the conceptual unity and historical continuity of Kant’s theoretical conception of God. It shows both the importance of the conception of God for understanding the development of Kant’s thought from the pre-critical onto the critical philosophy, and its significant role in the Kantian account of theoretical rationality. I maintain that there is a single idea that guided Kant in construing the metaphysical conception of God traceable early on from the pre-critical philosophy, that of grounding the unity and necessity of the laws of nature. I examine how Kant’s critical adaptation of this prevalent early modern rationalistic position enables him to transform the conception of God from an object of metaphysical inquiry into a regulative idea of reason.  My interpretation thus explains the connection, mostly ignored in the literature, between the rationalist metaphysical conception of God and the regulative role it affords in the critical system.

## Research plans
{{%expand "History of Philosophy"%}}
​Extending my work on Kant’s philosophy of religion, I am planning to work on the following papers. One is a paper about the role of God in the Critique of the Power of Judgment. I explain why the faculty of reflective judgment is introduced as an addition to the faculty of reason by relating it to the notion of God as an intuitive intellect. A second paper is about the relation between Kant’s moral and theoretical conceptions of God. While acknowledging Kant’s repeated claims about the superiority of the moral conception over the theoretical one, I argue that the latter informs in a significant way the former regarding its content and its epistemic status. 

In addition to Kant, I am interested in working on less-researched figures in late 18th and early 19th century German philosophy. One paper I plan is about Moses Mendelssohn’s proof for the existence of God in the Morning Hours. Mendelssohn claims that this proof is entirely original, yet it has received little attention in the literature. My paper will reconstruct this proof in detail, situating it in a class of proofs which includes Leibniz’s proof from eternal truths and Kant’s pre-critical possibility proof. I will argue that Mendelssohn’s original proof responds to shortcomings found in the latter proofs. In another paper, I plan to explore the theological position of Lessing’s Christianity of Reason and Mendelssohn’s charitable appropriation of it. I suggest that these texts present an interesting theological alternative vis-à-vis Kant on the one hand and rationalism on the other hand.

{{%expand "Practical Philosophy"%}}
In one project inspired by Kant’s account of hope, I wish to investigate the role of hope in political activism. While there is a growing body of philosophical literature exploring the nature of hope, an account of the social-political dimensions of hope is still lacking. I suggest that hope figures not only in the attitudes of individuals involved in political activity, but that it is also required for characterizing the collective nature of activism and its ends. A standard account of hope analyzes it to include the belief that a desired outcome is possible though not certain. While hope does not depend on a judgment of probability, it can be responsive to evidence, increasing in light of ‘signs for hope’. Thus by utilizing Kant’s account of reflective judgment, I maintain that hope also involves a second-order disposition to look for and be receptive to such signs. Therefore, I augment the account of hope with a collective element which is the act of creating signs of hope in the public sphere. In the context of political action, this means creating signs for the possibility of social change. Taking a cue from Kant’s principle of the purposiveness of nature, I suggest transposing it to signs of hope in the social realm in the following ways. One type of sign is the formation of solidarity between disadvantaged groups which have seemingly unrelated interests. That would be a sign that a shared vision of justice is realizable through collective political action. A second type is the emergence of internal organization, for example in unionization or local grassroots campaigns. In addition to the immediate causes, such activities are signs for the very possibility of collective political agency. Thus the outcomes of solidarity and agency are valued not only instrumentally for specific policy changes but also because they foster in the agents of change and their intended audience the hope that political action can make a difference.

{{%expand "Metaphysics"%}}
The second project I plan to pursue applies the Kantian critique of metaphysics to contemporary analytic metaphysics. In my work on Kant’s doctrine of regulative ideas, I show how certain metaphysical theories are meaningful not because they provide knowledge about what reality is like, but rather in virtue of expressing how we ought to think about reality according to rational norms. I propose that this account of Kantian regulative metaphysics can provide a new framework for understanding various debates related to truthmaking, grounding, and fundamentality. These debates revolve around the question whether there are facts or entities that are more fundamental than others in explaining features of reality, and if there are, what are they and what is the nature of this explanatory grounding relation. By applying the notion of regulative metaphysics, I suggest that some disputes are substantial, i.e., not merely verbal, even though there is no fact of the matter that allows their resolution. For example discussions of grounding and fundamentality often appeal to various criteria such as explanatory completeness, parsimony, and naturalness. Yet the justification of those principles and the knowledge they afford is usually unaccounted for. Kant’s regulative metaphysics provides an example of how to make explicit the interests underlying disputed metaphysical theories and grant them significance in virtue of different types of explanatory norms.

{{%expand "Digital Humanities"%}}
In addition to the above plans, I am interested in applying my 15 years’ experience in software engineering to explore new research in Digital Humanities. In my work I use extensively the online version of Kant’s gesammelte Schriften, utilizing tools I develop to improve its functionality. For example, I am building a database of Kant's handwritten notes (Reflexionen) adding visualizations of date ranges and cross-references to the location of the notes in Kant’s books. I intend to make the tool publicly available through a web interface. I plan to develop further digital research on historical texts, collaborate on interdisciplinary projects, and take part in propagating the methodologies of the Digital Humanities.
